## Log Management Requirement
IMPORTANT: When processing or applying these rules, all actions must be logged according to the guidelines in `log_management_rules.mdc`. This includes tracking updates needed, feedback received, exceptions, and effectiveness metrics.

## Action Items Management
1. Backlog Management:
   1.1. Issues, feedback, improvements, and exceptions should be tracked in the "Action Items Backlog" section of `ai_log.md`.
   1.2. Each entry must have a date, rule reference, type, description, status, and resolution (when applicable).
   1.3. The type must be one of: `Update`, `Feedback`, `Improvement`, or `Exception`.
   1.4. Status must be one of: `Open`, `In Progress`, `Resolved`, `Won't Fix`, or `Duplicate`.

2. Item Tracking:
   2.1. When a new issue is identified, create a new entry with status `Open`.
   2.2. When working on an issue, update its status to `In Progress`.
   2.3. When an issue is addressed, update its status to `Resolved` and provide resolution details.
   2.4. Never delete items from the backlog; instead, update their status accordingly.

3. Exception Documentation:
   3.1. When a rule cannot be applied, create a new entry with type `Exception`.
   3.2. In the description field, include the context, reason for deviation, and alternative approach used.
   3.3. If the exception indicates a problem with the rule itself, consider creating an additional entry with type `Update`.

## Entry Format Standards
4. Reference Format: Always include rule numbers and file names in references (e.g., "Rule 5 in cursor_rules_guide.mdc").
   4.1. Use YYYY-MM-DD format for dates.
   4.2. Provide specific context for all entries.

5. Backlog Organization: Keep the backlog organized by status for easy tracking.
   5.1. Use tables for structured data as shown in the template.
   5.2. Review the backlog regularly to identify patterns and prioritize improvements.

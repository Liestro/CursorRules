## Updates and Feedback Management
1. Updates Tracking:
    - When a rule seems outdated, unclear, or ineffective, log it under `## Updates Needed` in `ai_log.md`
    - Include the rule number, brief explanation of the issue, and recommendation for improvement

2. Feedback Collection:
    - When receiving feedback about a rule, log it under `## Feedback Log` in `ai_log.md`
    - Include the rule number, feedback source, and summary of the feedback

## Exception Handling
3. Exceptions Documentation:
    - Document any case where a rule cannot be applied under `## Exceptions` in `ai_log.md`
    - Include the rule number, context, reason for deviation, and alternative approach used

## Performance Tracking
4. Metrics Collection:
    - Track all rule applications under `## Effectiveness Metrics` in `ai_log.md`
    - For each application, document:
      a) Rule number and context
      b) Outcome (positive/negative/neutral)
      c) Brief explanation of impact
      d) Any improvement suggestions

## Entry Format Standards
5. Reference Format:
    - Always include rule numbers and file names in references (e.g., "Rule 5 in cursor_rules_guide.mdc")
    - Use YYYY-MM-DD format for dates
    - Provide specific context for all entries
    - Document alternative approaches for exceptions

6. Entry Organization:
    - Keep entries in reverse chronological order (newest first)
    - Use tables for structured data as shown in the template
    - Remove resolved issues to maintain the file as a backlog rather than a historical log

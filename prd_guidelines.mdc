description: Guidelines for writing Product Requirements Documents (PRD)
globs: **/prd/*.md
---
## File Location
1. Place all PRD files in the `instructions` directory in the root of the project, unless the user explicitly specifies another location.
2. Name PRD files descriptively, reflecting the feature or product they document (e.g., `user_authentication_prd.md`).

## General Structure
3. Every PRD must begin with a clear title, version number, and last updated date at the top of the document.
4. Include a concise executive summary (maximum 200 words) that outlines the product's purpose, target audience, and key features.
5. Organize the PRD into clearly defined sections using Markdown headings (##) for major sections and (###) for subsections.
6. Number all requirements sequentially for easy reference (e.g., REQ-001, REQ-002).

## Content Requirements
7. Include a "Problem Statement" section that clearly articulates the user problem being solved and its business impact.
8. Define specific, measurable success criteria for the product in the "Success Metrics" section.
9. List all stakeholders in a dedicated "Stakeholders" section, including their roles and responsibilities.
10. Document all assumptions and constraints that may impact product development in a dedicated section.

## Feature Documentation
11. Structure each feature description with: ID, title, description, user story, acceptance criteria, and priority level.
12. Write user stories in the format: "As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]."
13. Define acceptance criteria as testable conditions that must be met for a feature to be considered complete.
14. Categorize features by priority using a clear system (e.g., "Must Have," "Should Have," "Could Have," "Won't Have").

## Visual Elements
15. Include wireframes, mockups, or diagrams to illustrate complex features or user flows.
16. Format all visual elements with descriptive captions and reference them directly in the relevant requirement text.
17. Use consistent styling for all diagrams and visual elements throughout the document.

## Technical Specifications
18. Document all technical requirements, including performance metrics, security requirements, and compliance needs.
19. Specify integration points with other systems or services in a dedicated "Integrations" section.
20. Include data models or schemas when relevant to understanding the product requirements.

## Review and Maintenance
21. Include a "Revision History" section that tracks all changes to the PRD, including date, author, and summary of changes.
22. Document open questions or decisions pending in a "Open Issues" section for transparency.
23. Establish a clear review and approval process with designated approvers listed in the document.

# AI Rule Application Log

This file serves as a log for tracking issues with rules, feedback received, and cases where exceptions were needed. It helps maintain and improve the rule system over time.

## Updates Needed

This section tracks rules that may need updates due to being outdated, unclear, or ineffective.

| Date | Rule Reference | Issue Description | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| 2024-03-05 | Rule 5, 8 in cursor_rules_guide.mdc | The rules about file structure and format are not sufficiently clear, leading to multiple iterations of corrections. | Add a complete example of the expected file structure with YAML frontmatter at the beginning of the document. Explicitly state that files should use YAML frontmatter with three dashes at the beginning and end, and should not include a top-level heading (# Title). |
| 2024-03-05 | Rule 14-17 in cursor_rules_guide.mdc | The agent does not proactively update the ai_log.md file without explicit user instruction. | Add a clear directive that the agent should automatically update ai_log.md after each significant interaction, especially when creating new rule files or when receiving feedback. This should be a mandatory step in the agent's workflow, not dependent on user prompting. |

## Feedback Log

This section tracks feedback received about specific rules.

| Date | Rule Reference | Feedback Source | Feedback Summary |
|------|----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| 2024-03-05 | testing_guidelines.mdc | User feedback | User requested that the file structure strictly follow the format of cursor_rules_guide.mdc, including YAML frontmatter with description and globs fields, and removal of the top-level heading. |
| 2024-03-05 | Rule 14-17 in cursor_rules_guide.mdc | User feedback | User requested that the agent proactively update the ai_log.md file after significant interactions without requiring explicit instructions to do so. |

## Exceptions

This section documents cases where rules could not be applied or required deviation.

| Date | Rule Reference | Context | Reason for Exception | Alternative Approach |
|------|----------------|---------|----------------------|----------------------|
| | | | | |

## Effectiveness Metrics

This section tracks successful applications of rules and their effectiveness.

| Date | Rule Reference | Application Context | Outcome (Positive/Negative/Neutral) | Explanation/Improvement Suggestions |
|------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 2024-03-05 | Rule 5, 8, 10 in cursor_rules_guide.mdc | Creation of testing_guidelines.mdc | Neutral | Initial implementation failed to correctly follow the file structure rules. Multiple iterations of corrections were required after user feedback. The file was first created without proper YAML frontmatter, then with incomplete frontmatter, and finally with the correct structure. This suggests that the rules for file structure should be more explicit with complete examples of the expected format. |

## Usage Guidelines

1. When logging an issue, always include the rule number and file name (e.g., "Rule 5 in cursor_rules_guide.mdc").
2. Add the current date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
3. Be specific about the context where the issue occurred.
4. For exceptions, always document the alternative approach that was taken.
5. This log is meant to be reviewed periodically by humans or AI to improve the rule system.

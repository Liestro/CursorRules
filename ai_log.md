# AI Rule Application Log

This file serves as a log for tracking issues with rules, feedback received, and cases where exceptions were needed. It helps maintain and improve the rule system over time.

## Updates Needed

This section tracks rules that may need updates due to being outdated, unclear, or ineffective.

| Date | Rule Reference | Issue Description | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| 2024-03-05 | Rule 14-17 in cursor_rules_guide.mdc | The agent does not proactively update the ai_log.md file without explicit user instruction. | Add a clear directive that the agent should automatically update ai_log.md after each significant interaction, especially when creating new rule files or when receiving feedback. This should be a mandatory step in the agent's workflow, not dependent on user prompting. |

## Feedback Log

| Date | Rule Reference | Feedback Source | Feedback Summary |
|------|----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| 2024-03-05 | Rule 14-17 in cursor_rules_guide.mdc | User feedback | User requested that the agent proactively update the ai_log.md file after significant interactions without requiring explicit instructions to do so. |

## Exceptions
